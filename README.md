Doodle Jump Pygame
==================

My first experience with both Python and Pygame. I took a summer course in Python and was unimpressed with what I learned, so I started this side project to hopefully gain usable knowledge.

Concepts I learned on this project:

- Python's storage of data
- Class inheritance
- Paths
- Dictionaries
- Python for loops
- Pygame in general
- Sprite collision
